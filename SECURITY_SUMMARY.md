# Security Implementation Summary

## ✅ Step 35 — Security & Compliance Pass - COMPLETED

This document summarizes the comprehensive security measures implemented in Splitwise++.

## 🔒 Security Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Security Headers (Helmet + CORS)
- ✅ **Content Security Policy (CSP)** with strict directives
- ✅ **Cross-Origin Resource Policy (CORP)** set to same-origin
- ✅ **Cross-Origin Opener Policy (COOP)** set to same-origin
- ✅ **Referrer Policy** set to no-referrer
- ✅ **HSTS** with 1-year max-age and preload
- ✅ **X-Frame-Options** set to DENY
- ✅ **X-Content-Type-Options** set to nosniff
- ✅ **X-XSS-Protection** enabled

### 2. CORS Configuration
- ✅ **Origin validation** against environment variable
- ✅ **Explicit methods** (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS)
- ✅ **Allowed headers** (Content-Type, Authorization, Idempotency-Key)
- ✅ **Exposed headers** (X-Request-ID)
- ✅ **Credentials** support enabled

### 3. Rate Limiting
- ✅ **Per-endpoint rate limits** with @nestjs/throttler
- ✅ **Redis-based throttling** for cluster safety
- ✅ **Different limits** for different endpoint types:
  - Auth endpoints: 5 requests/minute
  - General endpoints: 100 requests/minute
  - File uploads: 10 requests/minute

### 4. Environment & Secrets Management
- ✅ **Environment validation script** (`scripts/check-env.ts`)
- ✅ **Required variables validation** with descriptions
- ✅ **Security recommendations** for production
- ✅ **Environment example file** (`env.example`)
- ✅ **Secrets hygiene** checks

### 5. Dependency & Container Security
- ✅ **Automated dependency scanning** in CI
- ✅ **Snyk integration** for vulnerability detection
- ✅ **Trivy container scanning** for Docker images
- ✅ **OWASP ZAP** automated security testing
- ✅ **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)** generation
- ✅ **Secrets detection** with TruffleHog

### 6. Structured Logging & Monitoring
- ✅ **Pino structured logging** with JSON output
- ✅ **Request ID tracking** for correlation
- ✅ **Error context** with user and request info
- ✅ **Production vs development** error responses
- ✅ **Log level configuration** via environment

### 7. Authorization Guards Verification
- ✅ **All controllers protected** with JwtAuthGuard
- ✅ **Group-scoped endpoints** use GroupMemberGuard
- ✅ **Owner-only operations** use GroupOwnerGuard
- ✅ **Public endpoints** (auth) properly configured
- ✅ **Role-based access control** implemented

### 8. GDPR/CCPA Compliance
- ✅ **Data export functionality** (`/me/privacy/export`)
- ✅ **Account deletion** with anonymization (`/me/privacy/delete`)
- ✅ **Soft delete** with anonymization support
- ✅ **Audit logging** for data access tracking
- ✅ **Privacy controls** for user data

## 🛡️ Security Testing & Validation

### Automated Security Scans
```bash
# Environment validation
pnpm tsx scripts/check-env.ts

# Dependency audit
pnpm audit --audit-level moderate

# Container security (when Docker image is built)
trivy image splitwise-plus:latest
```

### CI/CD Security Pipeline
- ✅ **Weekly security scans** scheduled
- ✅ **Dependency audit** on every PR
- ✅ **Container vulnerability scanning**
- ✅ **OWASP ZAP baseline testing**
- ✅ **Secrets detection** in code
- ✅ **SBOM generation** for compliance

## 📋 Security Checklist Status

### Pre-Deployment Security Review
- ✅ All environment variables validated
- ✅ JWT secrets are 32+ characters
- ✅ No default secrets in production config
- ✅ CORS origins properly configured
- ✅ All endpoints protected with guards
- ✅ Input validation on all user inputs
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- ✅ Error messages don't leak sensitive info
- ✅ File uploads properly validated
- ✅ Dependencies audited and updated
- ✅ Security headers properly configured

### Production Security Measures
- ✅ **Helmet.js** with comprehensive security headers
- ✅ **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- ✅ **Input validation** with class-validator
- ✅ **SQL injection prevention** via Prisma ORM
- ✅ **XSS protection** via CSP headers
- ✅ **CSRF protection** via SameSite cookies
- ✅ **File upload security** with MIME validation
- ✅ **Audit logging** for security events
- ✅ **Data encryption** in transit (HTTPS)
- ✅ **Secrets management** via environment

## 🚨 Incident Response & Monitoring

### Security Monitoring
- ✅ **Structured logging** for security events
- ✅ **Request ID tracking** for correlation
- ✅ **Error context** with user information
- ✅ **Audit trail** for all user actions
- ✅ **Failed authentication** tracking

### Security Alerts (Recommended)
- High 5xx error rates (>1% in 5 minutes)
- Multiple failed authentication attempts
- Unusual file upload patterns
- Cross-group access attempts
- Privilege escalation attempts
